About
本数据集基于几种常见类型的科幻网络小说制作，内容为一组种子提示词（seed prompts）。
提示词来源：主要情节与主要角色均抽取自对照组的人类创作小说。 
研究目的：通过这些提示词，探索大语言模型在小说生成中的表现，考察其在叙事结构、人物塑造与想象力方面的潜能与差异。
应用场景：该数据可用于 AIGC 文学研究、叙事学实验，以及人机协同写作的探索。
⚠️ 注意：该数据集仅用于学术研究与教学实验，不代表最终文学作品的价值判断
This dataset is based on categories of science fiction web novels, consisting of a collection of seed prompts.

Source of prompts: The main plots and key characters were extracted from human-written novels that serve as a control group.

Purpose: The dataset is designed to explore how large language models generate novels when provided with structured seed prompts, with a focus on narrative structure, character development, and imaginative scope.

Use cases: Suitable for research on AI-generated literature, narrative studies, and experiments in human–AI collaborative writing.

⚠️ Note: This dataset is intended for academic research and educational purposes only. It does not represent any final literary evaluation.
